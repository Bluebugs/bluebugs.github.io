&lt;p>A few years ago, I met some of the members of the team behind the development of the &lt;em>J-Core&lt;/em>, a &lt;em>SuperH&lt;/em> clone, and had some really interesting discussions with them. Using this &lt;a href="http://www.shared-ptr.com/sh_insns.html">resource&lt;/a>, I created, for my own understanding, a &lt;a href="https://bluebugs.github.io/json/insns.json">JSON file&lt;/a> and the dynamic table below to help me navigate and understand the &lt;em>SuperH&lt;/em> instruction set. I also added J2-related instructions that were not present in the initial material. As I turn off my &lt;em>AWS&lt;/em> account, I realized I could just share it via a &lt;em>GitHub&lt;/em> page. Here is a bit more context about &lt;em>SuperH&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
